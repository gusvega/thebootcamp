- Dynamic Programming
    - an optimization technique
    - great for cashing

Cashing ~~~~~~~ Memoization

Great way to uptimize our code

way to speed up program and hold data in a box/data structure

memoization is a way of remembering a solution to a problem so you dont have to calculate again

closure in javascript are good for using memoization inside functions/ and not use global objects

RULES:
- Dynamic Programming = Divide and Conquer + Memoization
1. Can the problem be devided into subproblems
2. Recursive solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblems?
4. Memoize subproblems
5. Demand a raise from your boss
