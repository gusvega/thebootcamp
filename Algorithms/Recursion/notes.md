# Recursion is a concept

# O(N)


- Recursion: Define something in terms of itself
- good for repeated tasks to do

- Every recursive function needs to have a base case
    - 1. Identify the base case
- Every Recursive function has to have a recursive case
    - Identify the recursive case
- Every recursive function has to have a a return 'to give the parent function a value'
    - Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns: for the base case and the recursive case. 

# Anything you do with recursion, can be done with iteration(loop)

Pros
- DRY : Dont Repeat yourself
- Readability

Downsides
- Large Stack

When to use recursion?
- traversion trees or graphs

- Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree consider recursion.
    - 1. Devided into a number or subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
    - 2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
    - 3. The solution of each subproblem can be conbined to solve the problem at hand
- Devide and Conquer using recursion

What algorithms use recursions?
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Tree Traversal
- Graph Traversal
