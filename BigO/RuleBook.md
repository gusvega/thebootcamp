Rule 1. Worst Case
    Rule 2. Remove Constants
        Rule 3. Different terms for inputs
            Rule 4. Drop Non Dominants

Rule 1
    Always use the wosrt case for every case

Rule 2
    Drop all constants in the function

Rule 3
    2 inputs (a + b) if in separate loops
    2 inputs (a * b) if nested loops

Rule 4
    alny leave the dominant term
